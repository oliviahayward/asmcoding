We received assistance for general debugging from Cindy Siu

We believe that for the most part our program has been correctly implemented
When we run tests with the random input generator we consistently pass for 100
elements and under, however when we go higher than that, our program produces
errors. We thought that this was due to our valuestack being too small, but we
increased the size from 10,000 to 50,000 and still got errors. We are unsure
about how to fix this.

We did not differ from the standard calling conventions.

We represent the value stack as stack of 10,000 elements, stored as the first
thing on the call stack.
